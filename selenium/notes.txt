1- Selenium
    - Selenium is an automation tool
    - Selenium automate the web application.
    - Selenium supports different languages and search engines.
    - Browsers compactibility means it support all the browsers like chrome, edge, safari etc..
    - We will use selenium in python like a library.

2- Selenium component
    Selenium has 4 types of component.
    1- Selenium web driver
    2- Selenium IDE
    3- Selenium Grid
    4- Selenium RC

    * What is Selenium Grid?
        - selenium grid is mainly used for parallel testing.
        - ig --> Testing different browsers at same time is called selenium grid.

    * What is Selenium IDE?
        - Selenium Integrated Development Environment.
        - It is used for playback testing.
        - Chose a browser and add IDE to that browser and it will check automatically.

    * What is Selenium RC?
        - Selenium Remote Controller.

    * What is Selenium Web Driver?
        - Webdriver is an interface.
        - Webdriver ia a part of selenium.
        - Webdriver directly interact with browser without any issue.
        - So Selenium webdriver is a interface who directly interact with browsers to run the app.
        Note - When webdriver connect with browsers it will call API.

3- How selenium works?
    - Selenium connect with webdriver and webdriver connect with Selenium API.
    - Start selenium server (We called selenium server either Hub/Node).
    - After connecting with server selenium check what URL has been given and then it send that
      url to applications server through API call.
    - After getting API Response it will go the webdriver then it will open browser and navigate to webpage.
    - Selenium navigating system works from browser to browser.
    - Mainly selenium send GET request to the API to fetch data.

4- What is URL?
    - Uniq identification of a URL.

5- Locater in selenium.
    - There are 8 types of locater available.
        -- id
        -- name
        -- classname
        -- tagname
        -- css selector
        -- xpath
        -- link text
        - partial link text

6- id - To find id we use find_element(By.ID, 'IDName')
      - We will send data using send_keys('Value')
      example- import selenium
               from selenium import webdriver
               import time
               from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

               # print(dir(selenium))
               driver = webdriver.Chrome()
               driver.get('https://www.facebook.com/login/')

               email= driver.find_element(By.ID, "email")
               password= driver.find_element(By.ID, "password")
               email.send_keys('soubhagya@gmail.com')
               password.send_keys('abc123')
               submit= driver.find_element(By.ID, 'submit')
               submit.click()

               time.sleep(5)
               driver.quit()

      - quit() function is used to close the open webdriver.
      - For any button tag we used click() function

7- xpath --> In xpath we have two path
             - Absolute path
             - Relative path

     (*) Absolute path- It is a static xpath starting from node root. Staring from parent to child.
             -> to use absolute path we have node root(parent-child relationship)
             -> If we have radio buttons then we use double slash to go for the parent //

          example- //div/span/span[2]/label/input #This is called custom path.
                --> If we don't have any ID or name to test the data we used custom path.
                --> male = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, //div/span/span[2]/label/input).click()


     (*) Relative xpath- It is a dynamic xpath, It is looking for attribute and value.
                -> //tagname[text()='text_name']/preceding-sibling::div
                -> //div[text()='SAMSUNG']/preceding-sibling::div                             # In function we don't use @

     Note=> //tagname[@attribute='value'], //input[@value='2']  # @is applicable only for attribute

8- Sibling are two types in python
    - Following-sibling --> If you are going Upper to lower it is called following-sibling. # It is for absolute path
    - preceding-sibling --> If you are going lower to upper it is called preceding-sibling. # It is for Relative path
    - //div[text()='SAMSUNG']/preceding-sibling::div # preceding-sibling example.

    jump to parent -- //tagname[@value='value']/parent::parent_tagname

9- Dropdown
    - There are two types of dropdown
        -- Selective dropdown
        -- Auto suggestive dropdown

    How to use Select-
        from selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select

        variable_name= Select(driver.find_element(By.ID, value))

        note=> So there are three important method.
        ** select_by_index()
        ** select_by_value()
        ** select_by_visible_text()
        ** all_selected_options()

        (Q) difference between verification and assertion.


10- Alert and Popup

11- Tabs
    driver= webdriver.Chrome()
    driver.get('https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/')

    driver.execute_script("window.open('')") # execute_script is used to switch from one tab to another.

    driver.close()

    ~ driver.window_handles # It is used to handel other tabs.
    ~ driver.switch_to.window()

12- Window
    driver.current_window_handel (it is used for main window)
    - driver.window_handels return type is list.


IMP--> driver.quit() # It is used to close multiple window.
       driver.close() # it is used to close single window.

13- iframe
    driver.switch_to.default_content() # It is used to back to the main window. While using iframe.

14- Wait Mechanism
    >> Wait mechanism are of three types.
        - Implicit wait
        - Explicit wait
        - Fluent wait

    Implicit wait- It is a common or global wait mechanism.
                 - No need to import it. We can use it directly.
                 - driver.implicitly_wait(5)

IMP >> visibility_of_element_located() - Wait until the element is visibil
       presenc_of_element_located() - Wait until the element is present
